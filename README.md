This experimental multi-screen experience leverages digital figures as a novel interface for human connection, moving beyond traditional text and voice communication to help people connect with each other across different screens like phones, tablets, or computers. Instead of just using text or talking, these digital figures perserves anonymity. Our goal is to see how using these digital characters in a shared online place can make connecting with strangers.
